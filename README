To compile both versions (sequential/parallel) under Linux the makefile can be 
used (simply run "make" in the directory). A Visual Studio project for the 
parallel version is also supplied.

Running the applications can be done as follows (in these examples 1000 is the 
limit):

Sequential:
Windows:
primes_sequential.exe 1000

Linux:
./primes_sequential 1000

Parallel:
Windows:
mpiexec -n 4 -machinefile machines.txt primes_parallel.exe 1000

Linux (note the full path to the executable):
mpiexec -n 4 -f machines.txt /home/adrian/primes/primes_parallel 1000
